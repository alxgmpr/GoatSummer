Gain a ton of contest entries. Use at your own risk. They might catch on and ban you from the contest. Not my fault.

# Requirements

# Usage

`~ git clone https://github.com/alxgmpr/GoatSummer.git`
###### Navigate to the project

# Known Issues

* If you get 429 from login its because your temporarily banned
* 403 is another request error. Nothing you can do except wait ~30 mins and try again
* Sometimes you can try and change headers from iPhone to iPad or iPod. But idk.
* Sleeps 1 second in between requests. Not sure if this is enough.
